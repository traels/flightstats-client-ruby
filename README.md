flightstats-flex
================

Ruby client for the FlightStats Flex API.

## Installation

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "flightstats-flex", "~> 0.3.0"
```

or

```ruby
gem 'flightstats-flex', :git => 'https://github.com/diditclear/flightstats-client-ruby'
```

Note that there is an old **flightstats** gem on [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/flightstats), hence the name **flightstats-flex** for this library.

## Usage

You only need to configure your FlightStats app id and keys:

```ruby
FlightStats.app_id = '1234'
FlightStats.app_key = '5678'
```

You can also specify your own logger:

```ruby
FlightStats.logger = Logger.new
```

When using Rails, you can set it up in an initializer (e.g. config/initializers/flightstats.rb):

```ruby
require 'flightstats'

FlightStats.app_id = '1234'
FlightStats.app_key = '5678'
FlightStats.logger = Rails.logger
```

### Extended options

The last argument of each API call is an optional hash. The `:params` key of that hash is used to pass query parameters.

For extended options, it looks like:

```
FlightStats::Airport.actives({ :params => { :extendedOptions => 'languageCode:fr' } })
FlightStats::Airport.actives({ :params => { :extendedOptions => 'useHTTPErrors+languageCode:fr' } })
```

## Contributing

There are two sets of tests.

The default one uses mock HTTP calls and can be run via:
```bash
rake test:spec
```

The remote ones will issue HTTP calls to FlightStats. You need to update your API credentials in spec/spec_helper.rb before running them:

```bash
rake test:remote:spec
```
